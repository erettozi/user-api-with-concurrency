# user-api-with-concurrency
UserAPIWithConcurrency is a RESTful API built in Golang that performs CRUD operations on user data. The project fetches additional user information concurrently from an external API, processes the data, and writes the results to a CSV file. It also includes a CLI tool for interacting with the API.
